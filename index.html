          <h2>Why Rio de Janeiro?</h2>
          <h3>Rio, the city between mountains and sea</h3>
          <p>
            Legend says that when Portuguese explorers first arrived at
            Guanabara Bay in January 1502, they mistook it for the mouth of a
            great river — hence the name *Rio de Janeiro*. But long before the
            arrival of Europeans, this land was home to the Tupinambá people,
            whose deep connection to the forest, the sea, and the sky still
            echoes through the city’s rhythm.
            <br /><br />
            Today, Rio is a place where nature and urban life embrace each other
            in dazzling harmony. From the lush peaks of the Tijuca Forest to the
            golden curves of Copacabana and Ipanema, the city unfolds in layers
            — of samba, sunsets, street art, colonial churches, and modernist
            icons. You can hike through the jungle in the morning, sip coconut
            water by the beach at noon, and watch the sun set behind Christ the
            Redeemer in the evening.
            <br /><br />
            More than a postcard, Rio is a feeling: warm, intense, and
            unforgettable. It’s a city that pulses to its own beat — vibrant,
            imperfect, and full of life.

          <p>
            Hello! I'm Bruna — and even though I’m not originally from Rio de
            Janeiro, I believe it’s one of the most breathtaking and vibrant
            cities in the world. I created this page as a tribute to Rio,
            combining my love for storytelling with my journey in front-end
            development.
